Hello, I'm Matthew Jiang, a third year Computer Science student at ***UC San Diego***. When I'm not busy programming or doing other school work, I enjoy playing rhythm games, going running, listening to music, and other such hobbies.

## I am familiar with:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript/CSS/HTML

Here's a typing speed [website](https://matthewmjiang.github.io/keymasher/) that I made a while back.

Here's some quoted text:
> Hello world!

Here's a basic program in C++:
```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here's the [README](README.md) for this repo.

Here's a [section link](https://github.com/mmjiang-ucsd/mmjiang-ucsd.github.io/blob/main/index.md#youve-reached-the-end-of-the-page-hooray) to go to the bottom of this page.
Here are the screenshots I took for this lab using relative links:

Things I want to do:
- [ ] Do more personal projects
- [ ] Get more exercise
- [ ] Sleep better
- [x] ~~play more video games~~
